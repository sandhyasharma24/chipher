1. Open Unity and Your Project
Launch the Unity Editor.
Open the project you are working on, or create a new project.
2. Navigate to the Hierarchy Window
The Hierarchy window is where you can see and organize all the GameObjects in your current scene.
3. Adding a Basic GameObject
Using the Menu Bar:
Click on GameObject in the menu bar at the top of the Unity window.
Select the type of GameObject you want to add from the dropdown menu. For example, 3D Object > Cube.
Using the Hierarchy Window:
Right-click in the Hierarchy window.
Select the type of GameObject you want to add from the context menu.
This will add the selected GameObject to your scene and it will appear in both the Scene view and the Hierarchy window.

4. Positioning and Transforming the GameObject
Select the newly added GameObject in the Hierarchy window.
In the Inspector window, you can modify the position, rotation, and scale of the GameObject using the Transform component.
You can also use the Move, Rotate, and Scale tools in the toolbar to manipulate the GameObject directly in the Scene view.
5. Adding Components to the GameObject
With the GameObject selected, go to the Inspector window.
Click the Add Component button at the bottom of the Inspector.
Select the component you want to add from the list. For example, you might add a Rigidbody to a 3D object to enable physics.
6. Creating Custom GameObjects
You can create a custom GameObject by adding various components and scripts to it.
To add a script, click the Add Component button and choose New Script. Name your script and click Create and Add. This will open your script in Visual Studio or your default code editor.
7. Organizing GameObjects
You can organize your GameObjects by creating empty GameObjects to serve as containers or parents for other GameObjects.
To create an empty GameObject:
Click on GameObject in the menu bar.
Select Create Empty.
You can then drag other GameObjects onto this empty GameObject in the Hierarchy window to make them children.
